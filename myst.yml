    Spindle Model Responsive to Mixed Fusimotor Inputs: an updated version of
    the Maltenfort and Burke (2003) model
  description: >-
    The muscle spindle model presented in Maltenfort & Burke (2003) calculates
    muscle spindle primary afferent feedback depending on the muscle fibre
    stretch and fusimotor drive.
